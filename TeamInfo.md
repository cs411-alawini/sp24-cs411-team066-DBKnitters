## Project Summary

EaseLease is a transformative online subletting platform created by UIUC students to address the unique housing challenges of university graduate programs. It aims to simplify the process of finding and managing short-term leases, thereby filling a void in the traditional rental market.

Landlords have access to Property Listing, Rental Management, Financial Reporting, Bidding System, and a Rewards Mechanism. For tenants, the platform provides Property Search and Filters, an Application Process, a Roommate Matching System, and the ability to Place a Bid. Collectively, these features are designed to facilitate a more efficient and user-friendly leasing process, ensuring that both landlords and tenants can navigate the rental landscape with confidence and ease.
