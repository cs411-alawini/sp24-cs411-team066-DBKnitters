We started At Home Inn Chicago in 2000 as a reservation service for bed and breakfasts in Chicago, and have since evolved into one of the city's most-respected sources for vacation rentals, corporate housing, and weekend getaways. 

We provide fully furnished vacation rentals and corporate housing throughout the city in or near Old Town and Lincoln Park.

We are here to answer all of your questions about Chicago, whether you need a restaurant recommendation, public transit tips, or insider tips on how to experience the Chicago that locals know and love. 

We love this city, especially getting ribs at Twin Anchors in Old Town before a show at Second City.  Topo Gigio is a great local Italian Restaurant and The Gemini Bistro is an excellent choice for fine dining. And Velvet Taco, casual with its own unique style on Lincoln is fabulous!

The free concerts at Pritzker Pavilion in Millenium Park can't be matched by any city in the world.

I'm Eric, 

Father of three great children. (grown and living on their own). Most recently three amazing grandchildren, so blessed! I enjoy traveling and anything that gets me outside. I believe there is nothing better than the experience of meeting new people, places, and sharing a meal, locally sourced of course!  I enjoy supporting local businesses, farmers markets, running, and living an environmentally conscious lifestyle. 

The world is always welcome at the door and invited in with a smile!  
I would love to have you stay!  
Happy Travels!

I allow only one guest so you don't have to worry about other strangers in the apartment. (I occupy the 2nd bedroom).  A single traveler will probably feel safe and be comfortable here. If you are visiting the University of Chicago - or visiting your UChicago student who hasn't enough room to host you - my location should allow you to walk to your destination. My Airbnb listing is also convenient to the Chicago Theological Seminary. 

Please let me know the purpose of your trip to Chicago so I can help you determine if my apartment (or Hyde Park location) is right for your visit.  I may even be able to suggest a more appropriate location. In any event, I will answer your inquiries quickly and honestly.",2613

2810938,"Who would have thought when I boarded a plane for Greece more than 20 years ago, planning on backpacking through the mountains and then heading north through then Yugoslavia I'd end up making Greece my second home?
But here I am, 20 something years later, with our fabulous biz ""Greek Vacation Rentals"",  opening up our amazing Acropolis view family & group friendly Athens apartments & our MagicFactoryLofts, spacious art filled homes in Chicago, while planning RealGreece travel itineraries and leading small group food & wine focused tours around my adopted homeland and loving the life that I am lucky enough to be living. Of course I did pick up an equally crazy, workaholic Greek husband along the way, as well as a stray Greek animal or two!

Update: January 2023 .... This year Basil and I celebrate 20 years opening our Greek vacation rentals to guests from around the world. All these years we've been hopping between Basil's home city, Athens and Carole's home city of Chicago.  Time and time again guests in Greece asked us if they can stay in our Chicago home while we're in Athens.... so now you can stay in Chicago in our art filled Magic Factory Lofts. We've got 3 and 4 bedroom homes in the heart of the city with Big Shoulders -  in our hybrid warehouse (which in a previous life housed a bar and a dance hall, followed by a costume and magic card factory and then a photography studio where probably every Butterball turkey advertisement in the 1980s was shot .... the photos, not the turkeys!)

So come stay with us ... and then stay with us again. Whether you'd like to enjoy an ouzo in Athens overlooking the Acropolis the Acropolis View Alpha or 7 bedroom  Acropolis SkyVilla, or a beer and a hot dog in Chicago while staying at  our Magic Factory Lofts  we know that you won't be disappointed. 

All of our places are perfect for 3 generation families, multiple couples (especially in Athens pre or post cruise), or groups of friends on a city break or vacation.",2810938

Chicago history, architecture, and preservation are big interests of mine, and I take great pride in caring for the historic properties my family has lived in, owned & maintained for decades. 

I love AirBnb.  We have traveled, backpacked, hiked, camped, hoteled moteled, couch-surfed and home-shared... But AirBnb has been the single best thing to happen to us in our adult lives.

When we travel, we turn to AirBnb first, whether internationally, nationally, and in our own hometown.  From the glitzy new city experience to weekend trip to some small town in the country, we prefer staying with those in the AirBnb community.  The experience is always unique and always more authentic.

We are AirBnb hosts and consider it central to our lives here in Chicago.  Because my family lives in Chicago, one of us is always in the city, often while the rest of us travel. Any repairs are handled immediately. A while back, when I was moving from the building we own, we decided to open it for AirBnB guests. Now we have progressed to having vacation rentals within the building where we live.  Living upstairs with my son allows us to keep in great touch with our guests, maintaining the gardens and accommodations ourselves, as well as hosting occasional art, music and dining events. 

I love this way of traveling and hosting; meeting the folks who come to stay with us is precisely what fuels me on the day-to-day, and it's what makes our vacations so much more enjoyable!

Airbnb Community Leader Host.
Art For Life Chicago, a non-profit organization. Founder and Philanthropist.

Proceeds to your stay will supports local artists and support my non-profit organization that help people in need  including youth homelessness.

Laid back, down to earth professional.  Volunteerism is healthy for the soul.  

Home to me isn't about how fancy the furniture is, the knick-knacks one collects or how well decorated the place is. Home is a feeling.  A really, really good feeling once you're inside from the hustle and bustle of work and the everyday life.  The home I created is full of memories when I was a kid both growing up here in the States and the Philippine countryside; my dad's mid-century furniture, my aunt's $1 table find in the second hand store, the discarded dresser I found on the Detroit curb ,the books that makes me happy when they're opened, and to the art collection that spans 30 years.  They're all inside.

As an Airbnb guest, you are welcomed and greeted with open arms during your stay. There is no hustle or bustle here.  Those glitz and trends are all outside.  Please note that this it's not a hotel because nothing here is perfect.  The wood floors creek, left over paint still clinging onto the wood door trims.  The linens are clothes lined sun-bleached, the flowers and fruits are fresh from the farmer's market and iced tea is made the old fashioned way. I truly believe that authenticity is the best form of luxury.  Please feel right at home.

2899484,"Hi!  :)  I'm Jason- a friendly, hyperactive, short and energetic fellow from the MidWest who loves building stuff and going places.  I'm a ""people-person"" from a family of world travelers; 4th generation Chicago cityboy with experience working in museums, hotels and ecolodges around the globe. 
Chicago history, architecture, and preservation are big interests of mine, and I take great pride in caring for the historic properties my family has lived in, owned & maintained for decades. 

I love AirBnb.  We have traveled, backpacked, hiked, camped, hoteled moteled, couch-surfed and home-shared... But AirBnb has been the single best thing to happen to us in our adult lives.

When we travel, we turn to AirBnb first, whether internationally, nationally, and in our own hometown.  From the glitzy new city experience to weekend trip to some small town in the country, we prefer staying with those in the AirBnb community.  The experience is always unique and always more authentic.

We are AirBnb hosts and consider it central to our lives here in Chicago.  Because my family lives in Chicago, one of us is always in the city, often while the rest of us travel. Any repairs are handled immediately. A while back, when I was moving from the building we own, we decided to open it for AirBnB guests. Now we have progressed to having vacation rentals within the building where we live.  Living upstairs with my son allows us to keep in great touch with our guests, maintaining the gardens and accommodations ourselves, as well as hosting occasional art, music and dining events. 

I love this way of traveling and hosting; meeting the folks who come to stay with us is precisely what fuels me on the day-to-day, and it's what makes our vacations so much more enjoyable!  We've met hundreds of incredible people and stayed in fantastic homes across the world.  AirBnb has been such a great chapter in our lives!  :)",2899484

I taught skiing in the Rockies and rode my BMW R65-LS from coast to coast.  When I was in Europe I was amazed at how willing people were to open their homes to a total stranger.  I had one of my best experiences living with a family in Romania in the Carpathian Mountains.  Amazing!  I feel this is the best way possible to travel.  It's part of why I love Air B&B.

I've done a fair amount of travel and have recently landed in my friend's one hundred year old building in the East Rogers Park neighborhood on the Northside of Chicago. I couldn't be happier about living in this location! Between being steps away from the beach, the friendly culturally diverse neighborhood, the up and coming restaurants, cafes, community run spaces and nightlife, I'm enjoying my lovely spacious nest and location. 

I've always liked addressing spaces in ways that speak to the function of each room making the environment fun to be in. In years past I've been a stylist and had a beautiful shop where I sold everything from vintage clothing, antique costumes from the Lyric Opera, kimonos and couture to art and vintage lifestyle items. I continue to style people mainly from my collection.

I spent four years running Open Secret Studios with the purpose of supporting art, culture and humanitarian causes. I rented out the space for photography, video and private events to support the things I care about. I became adept at providing a beautiful backdrop and supporting clients while keeping them happy before, during, and after event experiences. I hope to do the same for you. 

I am offering my home to travelers and am happy to give you space and share information about events going on around town. I have lived all over the city from Downtown to the Westside to Fulton Market and have found Rogers Park appealing on many levels without the pretension. I love living so close to the lake and look forward to discovering historic architecture on my walks through the neighborhood.

I practice yoga and meditation as well as swim, hike, bike, and make art in my  studio in the house. I make collage and mosaic from old ceramic pieces and plates found on beaches all over the world. I also work in textiles. 

In the future, I would love to find myself part of a group creating an upscale communal environment with a garden, private and public spaces, studios, and  indoor and outdoor spaces to host speakers, film makers, musicians and chefs to engage the community.

With over 20 years of travelling we could easily write our own book on travelling on a budget.  We PRIDE ourselves on the deals we obtain.  A week in Ireland, rental of two 3 bedroom entire homes for $45! FOUR Chicago Bull playoff games during the Michael Jordan Era included 4th row floor seats, box seats...$100 total!  Travelled europe thru 15 countries for $500 including accommodations and food...for a 3 month period!  And this was BEFORE Airbnb. We can go on.  We are geeked when we find a deal and become just plain silly with happiness at an unbelievable deal.  Even upon confirmation, our website for our guests are filled with free and things to do for CRAZY CHEAP.  'Spend like a spencer, but live like a king!'  

We feel everyone should open their minds to new things, cultural experiences and diversity.  Only then can you understand people thru their eyes and not some narrow minded media coverage.  By letting their experience be your experience will help you better understand people in a true and raw sense.  That's why we simply love Airbnb.

54076186,"Hello!  My name is Jennifer and I am the founder of Ovation Rentals, LLC which specializes in connecting hosts (including myself!) with guests looking for short- and long-term rental units in Chicago and Southwest Michigan.  We have something for everyone, from the unexpected visitor just needing a safe, comfortable place to rest her head to a family planning a big reunion on Lake Michigan.  

I am originally from Chicago, but when to college in UPENN in Philadelphia and also lived in New York before settling back in the Second City.  I have been a lover of travel for as long as I remember.  I took my first international trip  (to Paris!) when I was just 15 years old.  I made a deal with my dad that if I could save up the money for the flights by working 2 summer jobs then he would pay for the hotel and meals.  I worked my butt off that summer and we spent Christmas in Paris...and I was hooked on world travel!  Before Airbnb existed, I did much of my international travel via Home Exchange - where you exchange homes with a host family in another city (NOT the same as ""couch surfing"" lol).  I found that experiencing a new city like a local was infinitely more enjoyable than staying in a stuffy hotel, so when Airbnb came along I was overjoyed to have a new way to ""live like a local!""  And eventually I evolved from just an Airbnb Traveler to an Airbnb Host.  

As a host I strive to help my guests experience all the things I love about the cities and towns that I love - the food, culture and  natural beauty - in comfortable accommodations that are reasonably priced.  I strive to do the same for the other hosts that I represent through Ovation.  Our goal is to make every guest feel truly at home!",54076186

My biggest achievement when traveling was hiking John Muir Trail (JMT), a long distance trail in the Sierra Nevada mountains range of California. The trail's length is 213.7 miles. Tough 27 days lived emerged with nature. 

My most spontaneous trip was to Hawaii, I went hiking Nāpali Coast Trail, 5-day adventure on Kauai Island, but I stayed two months instead. Visited 6 islands with people I've met along the way. Traveling is amazing, builts relationships that last lifetime. 
I enjoy reading, books fuel my imagination. I participate in Triathlons and alike, those motivate me to stay in shape. When I have spare time, I move to the world of art. Chicago Art Institute is so big and has an extensive art collection that took me a good month to feel comfortable getting around. Great place to hang out with friends and family. 
I enjoy musical events, concerts are all over the place here in Chicago. And whats better than tailgating before the sporting game.

Our space offers fellow travelers a little southern hospitality in the city we can't live without. Other things we can't live without - Dark Matter coffee, good wine, good friends (and the just okay ones, too), good beer, and laughing a lot from all of the above. 

We hope our own experiences have created the perfect space that ensures you have a wonderful local experience in a global city, if there's anything we can do to help, it's against our constitution not to try so just ask! 

When we're not traveling as much and as far as possible, a few other things we enjoy are live music (seriously, a LOT of live music and we met at a music festival), camping, golfing, reading (Tom Robbins is a fave), meeting new people and exploring one of the greatest foodie cities in the world (hope our guidebook helps!) If requested, we're more than happy to offer recommendations and advice that only locals could know.

When I turned 19 I realized that I was a closet wanderer.  So I hit the road and covered much of the U.S. and all of Europe.  I taught skiing in the Rockies and rode my BMW R65-LS from coast to coast.  When I was in Europe I was amazed at how willing people were to open their homes to a total stranger.  I had one of my best experiences living with a family in Romania in the Carpathian Mountains.  Amazing!  I feel this is the best way possible to travel.  It's part of why I love Air B&B.  Hotel shmotel!  Live the life of the area.  That's an experience.  Now my wandering days are over.  I'm rooted in one of the coolest communities I know.  Rich with art and spirit. I have two amazing girls that help me garden, can, collect eggs and milk.  My partner is a fellow East Coast boy, world class jazz pianist and my right hand man.

A week in Ireland, rental of two 3 bedroom entire homes for $45! FOUR Chicago Bull playoff games during the Michael Jordan Era included 4th row floor seats, box seats...$100 total!  Travelled europe thru 15 countries for $500 including accommodations and food...for a 3 month period!  And this was BEFORE Airbnb. We can go on.

We feel everyone should open their minds to new things, cultural experiences and diversity.  Only then can you understand people thru their eyes and not some narrow minded media coverage.  By letting their experience be your experience will help you better understand people in a true and raw sense.  That's why we simply love Airbnb.

When I turned 19 I realized that I was a closet wanderer.  So I hit the road and covered much of the U.S. and all of Europe.  I taught skiing in the Rockies and rode my BMW R65-LS from coast to coast.  When I was in Europe I was amazed at how willing people were to open their homes to a total stranger.  I had one of my best experiences living with a family in Romania in the Carpathian Mountains.  Amazing!  I feel this is the best way possible to travel.  It's part of why I love Air B&B.  Hotel shmotel!  Live the life of the area.  That's an experience.  Now my wandering days are over.  I'm rooted in one of the coolest communities I know.  Rich with art and spirit. I have two amazing girls that help me garden, can, collect eggs and milk.  My partner is a fellow East Coast boy, world class jazz pianist and my right hand man.

I have fun with my family skiing and sailing our 24  foot San Juan in the summer, going out to the movies, or the opera, or a bike ride along Chicago's lake front or just playing charades at home.  I enjoy reading but lately most of my spare time is spent in the garden and home improvement projects.  I am passionate about my students and I would like to take a group of inner city student to Europe.  This is one of my educational dreams. 
I am Jamaican.  I visit home to see my mother some times.  My son's father is from southern Italy so we eat pasta often :) .  I speak Patios, some Spanish, Italian and German and English.  I love getting lost in nature and meeting people from differing cultures and countries.  And I like adventure.  We once drove from Chicago to New York for Christmas to see my family, then from New Your through Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala to Honduras to see my son's father family and back to Chicago.  That was my longest road trip.  I have done some short treks in the Himalayas in Nepal and India, I have done some scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef and have ridden a motorcycle across the US. The rest you can find when you visit, or not, I am happy either way.  If you visit during sailing season you are invited to go sailing with us.  
Happy trails and I wish you a happy and amazing life.",28501460

-  I've moved 7 times in 20 years for my career.  But Chicago is hands down my favorite place to call home!
-  Found myself an amazing Chicago native and we recently married.  We postponed our July 2020 wedding due to COVID but pulled off an amazing wedding in my hometown of Saratoga Springs, NY in July of 2021.  I inherited a beautiful step-daughter in the process.
-  Coffee in the morning, Wine in the evenings.  Yep!
-  I've been a featured extra on several episodes of Chicago PD and Chicago Fire...once playing a dead body.  So fun!
-  In my 8 years in Chicago, I've rarely eaten at the same restaurant twice.  Too many amazing choices!",89891209

Of course I did pick up an equally crazy, workaholic Greek husband along the way, as well as a stray Greek animal or two!

Update: January 2023 .... This year Basil and I celebrate 20 years opening our Greek vacation rentals to guests from around the world. All these years we've been hopping between Basil's home city, Athens and Carole's home city of Chicago.  Time and time again guests in Greece asked us if they can stay in our Chicago home while we're in Athens.... so now you can stay in Chicago in our art filled Magic Factory Lofts. We've got 3 and 4 bedroom homes in the heart of the city with Big Shoulders -  in our hybrid warehouse (which in a previous life housed a bar and a dance hall, followed by a costume and magic card factory and then a photography studio where probably every Butterball turkey advertisement in the 1980s was shot .... the photos, not the turkeys!)

So come stay with us ... and then stay with us again.

73423516,"We purchased and rehabbed our home to accommodate our fast growing family. We were looking for a safe and diverse neighborhood in the inner city where neighbors are neighborly and the things we do and enjoy most about Chicago are within walking distance. We couldn't be more satisfied with our choice. As a family, we have had the opportunity to travel to many countries, states, and cities but found nothing quite as down to earth and historically sound as Chicago. 

We are a family of people who love to get out and take advantage of the many parks, museums, restaurants, and festivities that make Chicago magnificent. We love being a few walking blocks from the beaches along Lake Shore Drive and we take full advantage of it during the summer seasons. We also enjoy walking or biking to the many historical museums, festivals, conventions, and some of the most wonderful restaurants choices the city has to offer.

Whether you are here for fun and pleasure or for business, please allow us to make your stay in Chicago one filled with joy, laughter, ooohs and ahhhs. Chicago has it all. Welcome to Chicago...Welcome HOME.

53964832,"Founded by travel enthusiasts who enjoy spaces that inspire, comfort and fuel. We’re fans of transforming old buildings with cool history into well outfitted apartment style hotels that honor the old while representing the now. Our vibe is fresh + fun with rooms that are stocked to support everyone from the homebody to the adventurer. We’ve created a well equipped basecamp for the explorer and a sanctuary for the traveler who needs to recharge, reset or just chill.

Our spaces are simple + clean punctuated by accents that bring the right amount of pop.

From the urban streets of Chicago to the wooded splendor of Michigan, we’ve got you.

The Neighborhood Hotel® in Lincoln Park 

Fourteen large, stylish suites feature thoughtful amenities for work and play, a stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, Sonos, and a well-curated collection of art and accessories that reflect the neighborhood's current vibe and history.

Located near the corner of Clark + Wrightwood in a landmark building from the late 1800's, guests are immersed with locals in one of Chicago's most desirable neighborhoods.

The Neighborhood® Grand Beach, Michigan

The Neighborhood Grand Beach is your escape — a place where nature’s bounty is celebrated and pure comfort is prioritized. Imagine your day beginning with sounds of nature, coffee by the campfire followed by a dip in the glistening pool or yoga near the ravine. The adventurer explores the woods and waters of Harbor Country followed by a round of golf or tennis. Meanwhile, the relaxed vacationer continues to bask (possibly reclined) amongst the native trees and greenery. The day comes to a close with a barbeque garnished with fresh herbs from the garden + s’mores under the stars (or in the plush living room for indoor folks).

Fourteen suite's provide the ideal blend of rustic cabin meets ethereal luxury. The common spaces are campy-hip with warm touches that even smell good (think wood paneled walls, aromatic pine trees, smoky embers). This is your place for adventure, connection, or to just chill.

Accessibility: The Neighborhood Hotels are located in a variety of old structures.  In Grand Beach, Michigan, you’ll find yourself in an old roadside in lodge from the early 1900’s.  In Lincoln Park (Chicago), you’ll be in a stately limestone clad building from the late 1800’s. Based on the architectural trends of the time, there may be a considerable amount of steps throughout our buildings. As some locations may not have elevators, some of our guests with mobility issues may find access challenging. Please allow us to assist you in any way possible. Please contact us to discuss your individual needs and we’ll accommodate to the best of our ability.",53964832

My name is Jennifer and I am the founder of Ovation Rentals, LLC which specializes in connecting hosts (including myself!) with guests looking for short- and long-term rental units in Chicago and Southwest Michigan.  We have something for everyone, from the unexpected visitor just needing a safe, comfortable place to rest her head to a family planning a big reunion on Lake Michigan.  

I am originally from Chicago, but when to college in UPENN in Philadelphia and also lived in New York before settling back in the Second City.  I have been a lover of travel for as long as I remember.  I took my first international trip  (to Paris!) when I was just 15 years old.  I made a deal with my dad that if I could save up the money for the flights by working 2 summer jobs then he would pay for the hotel and meals.  I worked my butt off that summer and we spent Christmas in Paris...and I was hooked on world travel!  Before Airbnb existed, I did much of my international travel via Home Exchange - where you exchange homes with a host family in another city (NOT the same as ""couch surfing"" lol).  I found that experiencing a new city like a local was infinitely more enjoyable than staying in a stuffy hotel, so when Airbnb came along I was overjoyed to have a new way to ""live like a local!""  And eventually I evolved from just an Airbnb Traveler to an Airbnb Host.  

As a host I strive to help my guests experience all the things I love about the cities and towns that I love - the food, culture and  natural beauty - in comfortable accommodations that are reasonably priced.  I strive to do the same for the other hosts that I represent through Ovation.  Our goal is to make every guest feel truly at home!",54076186

We’re fans of transforming old buildings with cool history into well outfitted apartment style hotels that honor the old while representing the now. Our vibe is fresh + fun with rooms that are stocked to support everyone from the homebody to the adventurer. We’ve created a well equipped basecamp for the explorer and a sanctuary for the traveler who needs to recharge, reset or just chill.

Our spaces are simple + clean punctuated by accents that bring the right amount of pop.

From the urban streets of Chicago to the wooded splendor of Michigan, we’ve got you.

The Neighborhood Hotel® in Lincoln Park 

Fourteen large, stylish suites feature thoughtful amenities for work and play, a stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, Sonos, and a well-curated collection of art and accessories that reflect the neighborhood's current vibe and history.

Located near the corner of Clark + Wrightwood in a landmark building from the late 1800's, guests are immersed with locals in one of Chicago's most desirable neighborhoods.

The Neighborhood® Grand Beach, Michigan

The Neighborhood Grand Beach is your escape — a place where nature’s bounty is celebrated and pure comfort is prioritized. Imagine your day beginning with sounds of nature, coffee by the campfire followed by a dip in the glistening pool or yoga near the ravine. The adventurer explores the woods and waters of Harbor Country followed by a round of golf or tennis. Meanwhile, the relaxed vacationer continues to bask (possibly reclined) amongst the native trees and greenery. The day comes to a close with a barbeque garnished with fresh herbs from the garden + s’mores under the stars (or in the plush living room for indoor folks).

Fourteen suite's provide the ideal blend of rustic cabin meets ethereal luxury. The common spaces are campy-hip with warm touches that even smell good (think wood paneled walls, aromatic pine trees, smoky embers). This is your place for adventure, connection, or to just chill.

Accessibility: The Neighborhood Hotels are located in a variety of old structures.  In Grand Beach, Michigan, you’ll find yourself in an old roadside in lodge from the early 1900’s.  In Lincoln Park (Chicago), you’ll be in a stately limestone clad building from the late 1800’s. Based on the architectural trends of the time, there may be a considerable amount of steps throughout our buildings. As some locations may not have elevators, some of our guests with mobility issues may find access challenging. Please allow us to assist you in any way possible. Please contact us to discuss your individual needs and we’ll accommodate to the best of our ability.",53964832

The Neighborhood Hotel® in Lincoln Park 

Fourteen large, stylish suites feature thoughtful amenities for work and play, a stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, Sonos, and a well-curated collection of art and accessories that reflect the neighborhood's current vibe and history.

Located near the corner of Clark + Wrightwood in a landmark building from the late 1800's, guests are immersed with locals in one of Chicago's most desirable neighborhoods.

The Neighborhood® Grand Beach, Michigan

The Neighborhood Grand Beach is your escape — a place where nature’s bounty is celebrated and pure comfort is prioritized. Imagine your day beginning with sounds of nature, coffee by the campfire followed by a dip in the glistening pool or yoga near the ravine. The adventurer explores the woods and waters of Harbor Country followed by a round of golf or tennis. Meanwhile, the relaxed vacationer continues to bask (possibly reclined) amongst the native trees and greenery. The day comes to a close with a barbeque garnished with fresh herbs from the garden + s’mores under the stars (or in the plush living room for indoor folks).

Fourteen suite's provide the ideal blend of rustic cabin meets ethereal luxury. The common spaces are campy-hip with warm touches that even smell good (think wood paneled walls, aromatic pine trees, smoky embers). This is your place for adventure, connection, or to just chill.

Accessibility: The Neighborhood Hotels are located in a variety of old structures.  In Grand Beach, Michigan, you’ll find yourself in an old roadside in lodge from the early 1900’s.  In Lincoln Park (Chicago), you’ll be in a stately limestone clad building from the late 1800’s. Based on the architectural trends of the time, there may be a considerable amount of steps throughout our buildings. As some locations may not have elevators, some of our guests with mobility issues may find access challenging. Please allow us to assist you in any way possible. Please contact us to discuss your individual needs and we’ll accommodate to the best of our ability.",53964832

I love to be in nature to feel the energy of the sun and breeze and watch the birds and other animals. I need to be outside daily.  I walk each dog each day to the beach even in ten below zero weather.  The ice formations were amazing this winter on lake Michigan.  I used to try to complete two triathlons per year.  I practice yoga and have been doing this since studying in India over twenty years ago.  I am currently a crew member and race weekly during boating season and have completed in 5 Chicago to Mackinac island race.  I have fun with my family skiing and sailing our 24  foot San Juan in the summer, going out to the movies, or the opera, or a bike ride along Chicago's lake front or just playing charades at home.  I enjoy reading but lately most of my spare time is spent in the garden and home improvement projects.  I am passionate about my students and I would like to take a group of inner city student to Europe.  This is one of my educational dreams. 
I am Jamaican.  I visit home to see my mother some times.  My son's father is from southern Italy so we eat pasta often :) .  I speak Patios, some Spanish, Italian and German and English.  I love getting lost in nature and meeting people from differing cultures and countries.  And I like adventure.  We once drove from Chicago to New York for Christmas to see my family, then from New Your through Mexico, El Salvador and Guatemala to Honduras to see my son's father family and back to Chicago.  That was my longest road trip.  I have done some short treks in the Himalayas in Nepal and India, I have done some scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef and have ridden a motorcycle across the US. The rest you can find when you visit, or not, I am happy either way.  If you visit during sailing season you are invited to go sailing with us.

I am a designer by profession and have a passionate love affair with travel, art, museums, and exploring this beautiful planet and it's fascinating cultures. The love for art is what attracted me and my husband Saad to Pilsen. It is filled with so much vibrance and culture, it's streets brimming with depictions of love, life, loss and beauty. It’s people have big hearts and vibrant minds which make this neighborhood produce talented artists, chefs and business owners. Cooking and good food feeds my soul and in Chicago we are spoilt for choices of every cuisine from all over the world. Pilsen alone has an abundance of never ending taquerias, bakeries and wonderful lineup of restaurants that never disappoint.

We’re fans of transforming old buildings with cool history into well outfitted apartment style hotels that honor the old while representing the now. Our vibe is fresh + fun with rooms that are stocked to support everyone from the homebody to the adventurer. We’ve created a well equipped basecamp for the explorer and a sanctuary for the traveler who needs to recharge, reset or just chill.

Our spaces are simple + clean punctuated by accents that bring the right amount of pop.

From the urban streets of Chicago to the wooded splendor of Michigan, we’ve got you.

The Neighborhood Hotel® in Lincoln Park 

Fourteen large, stylish suites feature thoughtful amenities for work and play, a stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, Sonos, and a well-curated collection of art and accessories that reflect the neighborhood's current vibe and history.

Located near the corner of Clark + Wrightwood in a landmark building from the late 1800's, guests are immersed with locals in one of Chicago's most desirable neighborhoods.

The Neighborhood® Grand Beach, Michigan

The Neighborhood Grand Beach is your escape — a place where nature’s bounty is celebrated and pure comfort is prioritized. Imagine your day beginning with sounds of nature, coffee by the campfire followed by a dip in the glistening pool or yoga near the ravine. The adventurer explores the woods and waters of Harbor Country followed by a round of golf or tennis. Meanwhile, the relaxed vacationer continues to bask (possibly reclined) amongst the native trees and greenery. The day comes to a close with a barbeque garnished with fresh herbs from the garden + s’mores under the stars (or in the plush living room for indoor folks).

Fourteen suite's provide the ideal blend of rustic cabin meets ethereal luxury. The common spaces are campy-hip with warm touches that even smell good (think wood paneled walls, aromatic pine trees, smoky embers). This is your place for adventure, connection, or to just chill.

Accessibility: The Neighborhood Hotels are located in a variety of old structures.  In Grand Beach, Michigan, you’ll find yourself in an old roadside in lodge from the early 1900’s.  In Lincoln Park (Chicago), you’ll be in a stately limestone clad building from the late 1800’s. Based on the architectural trends of the time, there may be a considerable amount of steps throughout our buildings. As some locations may not have elevators, some of our guests with mobility issues may find access challenging. Please allow us to assist you in any way possible.

We greatly appreciate the support of our guests in the past many years. Not only we have expanded our teams, we have also increased the number of hosting facilities. We have rooms ranging from more economic models for thrift travelers to luxurious rooms for exceptional experience. With the facilities we have, the guests have a greater choices of suitable locations and budget levels. We have also re-designed some of our facilities so the entire suite or entire floor can be rented.

Most of our hosting facilities include a full kitchen (for light cooking only, as a courtesy to other guests), microwave, refrigerator, washer and dryer.

While I was there I worked with a very skilled practitioner of Chinese Medicine and so decided to pursue my studies in Acupuncture and Herbal Medicine back in the US. After studying for four years post-graduate, I went back to Asia to volunteer in Nepal, Bali, and Thailand, and then founded a non-profit to send more acupuncture volunteers to work in free Nepali clinics. I enjoy my work immensely and still travel to Asia a few times each year. I moved back to Chicago a few years go and bought a beautiful 100 year old home last year. I still travel quite a bit and so am looking for a responsible tenant to share my peaceful space with. When I am in Chicago I am also an avid tango dancer and yoga practitioner.

We are both very outgoing and put a lot of time and effort into this very old building. It was a bed and breakfast before we bought it but had been deeply neglected, so we’re working hard to try and give it new life",8803468

To this day we have friends, in Fiji, London, Ireland, India, Belgium, Costa Rica, and so many more.  Now I've got three little boys, and makes it a little more difficult to get out and travel as much as I'd want to.  So we thought to ourselves, let's bring the world to us.  Let us meet fantastic people, and share the stories of what their part of the world has to offer.  We love adventure, discovering new things, The Chicago Cubs, Chicago Foods, music, dancing, Improv Comedy and we love a good happy hour.  I like to think of us as the ultimate Chicago host, because we know all the little secrets this city has to offer.

2810938,"Who would have thought when I boarded a plane for Greece more than 20 years ago, planning on backpacking through the mountains and then heading north through then Yugoslavia I'd end up making Greece my second home?
But here I am, 20 something years later, with our fabulous biz ""Greek Vacation Rentals"",  opening up our amazing Acropolis view family & group friendly Athens apartments & our MagicFactoryLofts, spacious art filled homes in Chicago, while planning RealGreece travel itineraries and leading small group food & wine focused tours around my adopted homeland and loving the life that I am lucky enough to be living. Of course I did pick up an equally crazy, workaholic Greek husband along the way, as well as a stray Greek animal or two!

Update: January 2023 .... This year Basil and I celebrate 20 years opening our Greek vacation rentals to guests from around the world. All these years we've been hopping between Basil's home city, Athens and Carole's home city of Chicago.  Time and time again guests in Greece asked us if they can stay in our Chicago home while we're in Athens.... so now you can stay in Chicago in our art filled Magic Factory Lofts. We've got 3 and 4 bedroom homes in the heart of the city with Big Shoulders -  in our hybrid warehouse (which in a previous life housed a bar and a dance hall, followed by a costume and magic card factory and then a photography studio where probably every Butterball turkey advertisement in the 1980s was shot .... the photos, not the turkeys!)

So come stay with us ... and then stay with us again. Whether you'd like to enjoy an ouzo in Athens overlooking the Acropolis the Acropolis View Alpha or 7 bedroom  Acropolis SkyVilla, or a beer and a hot dog in Chicago while staying at  our Magic Factory Lofts  we know that you won't be disappointed.

We’re fans of transforming old buildings with cool history into well outfitted apartment style hotels that honor the old while representing the now. Our vibe is fresh + fun with rooms that are stocked to support everyone from the homebody to the adventurer. We’ve created a well equipped basecamp for the explorer and a sanctuary for the traveler who needs to recharge, reset or just chill.

Our spaces are simple + clean punctuated by accents that bring the right amount of pop.

From the urban streets of Chicago to the wooded splendor of Michigan, we’ve got you.

The Neighborhood Hotel® in Lincoln Park 

Fourteen large, stylish suites feature thoughtful amenities for work and play, a stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, Sonos, and a well-curated collection of art and accessories that reflect the neighborhood's current vibe and history.

Located near the corner of Clark + Wrightwood in a landmark building from the late 1800's, guests are immersed with locals in one of Chicago's most desirable neighborhoods.

The Neighborhood® Grand Beach, Michigan

The Neighborhood Grand Beach is your escape — a place where nature’s bounty is celebrated and pure comfort is prioritized. Imagine your day beginning with sounds of nature, coffee by the campfire followed by a dip in the glistening pool or yoga near the ravine. The adventurer explores the woods and waters of Harbor Country followed by a round of golf or tennis. Meanwhile, the relaxed vacationer continues to bask (possibly reclined) amongst the native trees and greenery. The day comes to a close with a barbeque garnished with fresh herbs from the garden + s’mores under the stars (or in the plush living room for indoor folks).

Fourteen suite's provide the ideal blend of rustic cabin meets ethereal luxury. The common spaces are campy-hip with warm touches that even smell good (think wood paneled walls, aromatic pine trees, smoky embers). This is your place for adventure, connection, or to just chill.

Accessibility: The Neighborhood Hotels are located in a variety of old structures.  In Grand Beach, Michigan, you’ll find yourself in an old roadside in lodge from the early 1900’s.  In Lincoln Park (Chicago), you’ll be in a stately limestone clad building from the late 1800’s. Based on the architectural trends of the time, there may be a considerable amount of steps throughout our buildings. As some locations may not have elevators, some of our guests with mobility issues may find access challenging. Please allow us to assist you in any way possible. Please contact us to discuss your individual needs and we’ll accommodate to the best of our ability.",53964832

Our vibe is fresh + fun with rooms that are stocked to support everyone from the homebody to the adventurer. We’ve created a well equipped basecamp for the explorer and a sanctuary for the traveler who needs to recharge, reset or just chill.

Our spaces are simple + clean punctuated by accents that bring the right amount of pop.

From the urban streets of Chicago to the wooded splendor of Michigan, we’ve got you.

The Neighborhood Hotel® in Lincoln Park 

Fourteen large, stylish suites feature thoughtful amenities for work and play, a stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, Sonos, and a well-curated collection of art and accessories that reflect the neighborhood's current vibe and history.

Located near the corner of Clark + Wrightwood in a landmark building from the late 1800's, guests are immersed with locals in one of Chicago's most desirable neighborhoods.

The Neighborhood® Grand Beach, Michigan

The Neighborhood Grand Beach is your escape — a place where nature’s bounty is celebrated and pure comfort is prioritized. Imagine your day beginning with sounds of nature, coffee by the campfire followed by a dip in the glistening pool or yoga near the ravine. The adventurer explores the woods and waters of Harbor Country followed by a round of golf or tennis. Meanwhile, the relaxed vacationer continues to bask (possibly reclined) amongst the native trees and greenery. The day comes to a close with a barbeque garnished with fresh herbs from the garden + s’mores under the stars (or in the plush living room for indoor folks).

Fourteen suite's provide the ideal blend of rustic cabin meets ethereal luxury. The common spaces are campy-hip with warm touches that even smell good (think wood paneled walls, aromatic pine trees, smoky embers). This is your place for adventure, connection, or to just chill.

Accessibility: The Neighborhood Hotels are located in a variety of old structures.  In Grand Beach, Michigan, you’ll find yourself in an old roadside in lodge from the early 1900’s.  In Lincoln Park (Chicago), you’ll be in a stately limestone clad building from the late 1800’s. Based on the architectural trends of the time, there may be a considerable amount of steps throughout our buildings. As some locations may not have elevators, some of our guests with mobility issues may find access challenging. Please allow us to assist you in any way possible. Please contact us to discuss your individual needs and we’ll accommodate to the best of our ability.",53964832

-Hebrews 13:2-

I am a fun and funny (yes, even though I am German....go figure!) person, who loves life and people.
 
My career in hotel business has provided hours of entertaining stories and interesting experiences. 

Growing up with two older sisters, I got stuck with their music - I love Classic Rock and listen to a variety of Pandora stations (Dropkick Murphy’s, Cafe Del Mar, Carlos Vives, Nigel Kennedy etc.) all day. 

My German roots and my family over there are very important to me, but my love for THIS country rules, and I fulfilled a childhood dream by living here.

I've lived in fabulous cities and made amazing friends along the way - I bet I have a story or two to share...

What else?! I ran the Chicago Marathon in '11, motorcycled through Canada in '15, I like boxing and kayaking, bicycling and seriously hanging out on my couch with a good book or a great movie. 

I also enjoy cooking, and love hosting people; I like heavy, dark wines and  whisk(e)y. 

My husband and I watch Netflix together in the evening, and you are always welcome to join us.

I've done a fair amount of travel and have recently landed in my friend's one hundred year old building in the East Rogers Park neighborhood on the Northside of Chicago. I couldn't be happier about living in this location! Between being steps away from the beach, the friendly culturally diverse neighborhood, the up and coming restaurants, cafes, community run spaces and nightlife, I'm enjoying my lovely spacious nest and location. 

I've always liked addressing spaces in ways that speak to the function of each room making the environment fun to be in. In years past I've been a stylist and had a beautiful shop where I sold everything from vintage clothing, antique costumes from the Lyric Opera, kimonos and couture to art and vintage lifestyle items. I continue to style people mainly from my collection.

I spent four years running Open Secret Studios with the purpose of supporting art, culture and humanitarian causes. I rented out the space for photography, video and private events to support the things I care about. I became adept at providing a beautiful backdrop and supporting clients while keeping them happy before, during, and after event experiences. I hope to do the same for you. 

I am offering my home to travelers and am happy to give you space and share information about events going on around town. I have lived all over the city from Downtown to the Westside to Fulton Market and have found Rogers Park appealing on many levels without the pretension. I love living so close to the lake and look forward to discovering historic architecture on my walks through the neighborhood.

I practice yoga and meditation as well as swim, hike, bike, and make art in my  studio in the house. I make collage and mosaic from old ceramic pieces and plates found on beaches all over the world. I also work in textiles. 

In the future, I would love to find myself part of a group creating an upscale communal environment with a garden, private and public spaces, studios, and  indoor and outdoor spaces to host speakers, film makers, musicians and chefs to engage the community.

53362437,"A few things about me? I enjoy traveling, meeting new people, movies, theater, live music, working out, reading and FOOD. So my favorite day would be traveling to a new place, waking up in a gorgeous hotel, then I'd stroll to a nearby park to workout, leisurely read a book in the shade, after returning to my room and taking a good nap on comfy clean sheets, I would hit the streets again, stumbling upon a hole in the wall that served delicious food and clever cocktails with a live band playing in the background.

136825532,"Hi! 
Thanks for visiting the profile page of FreeStand Home Solutions! 

We here at FHS, operate a corporate housing company, which means businesses and companies contract with us for housing, which typically averages 5-6 months.

We are NOT in the business of vacation renting. 

We simply list on these platforms because this is where businesses and companies come to search for housing.

Due to the nature of our business, we allow these same companies to ""extend"" their stay if they issue a request, 21 days prior to their lease expiration. 

If you are seeking long-term housing (30+ days), please submit an inquiry. Even if we do not have availability, we have additional temp housing companies we can recommend. We also have 50+ homes, so we are able to recommend an open location.

If you are seeking short-term housing (less than 30 days), we have a partner we work with, who may have availability. 

Please reach out to our office with additional questions, support and inquiries.
Pricing & calendar availability is accurate on FHS website only.

I am from Colombia, currently an international student. My favorite food is pasta, arepas and some good beans make my day good! I love watching Netflix, coking and hosting people.

We greatly appreciate the support of our guests in the past many years. Not only we have expanded our teams, we have also increased the number of hosting facilities. We have rooms ranging from more economic models for thrift travelers to luxurious rooms for exceptional experience. With the facilities we have, the guests have a greater choices of suitable locations and budget levels. We have also re-designed some of our facilities so the entire suite or entire floor can be rented. With the large number of guests we served each year, we rely more on self check-in, and regrettably your host may not be able to meet you in person as in the past.

All our facilities are located very convenient and safe neighborhood. We may not have all the bell and whistle of hotel, but in some areas we actually provides more. Most of our hosting facilities include a full kitchen (for light cooking only, as a courtesy to other guests), microwave, refrigerator, washer and dryer. Of course, we have wifi, and internet-ready TV. We would like you to feel that you are staying in a functional home and can stay for an extended period of time.",22094147

Thanks for visiting the profile page of FreeStand Home Solutions! 

We here at FHS, operate a corporate housing company, which means businesses and companies contract with us for housing, which typically averages 5-6 months.

We are NOT in the business of vacation renting. 

We simply list on these platforms because this is where businesses and companies come to search for housing.

Due to the nature of our business, we allow these same companies to ""extend"" their stay if they issue a request, 21 days prior to their lease expiration. 

If you are seeking long-term housing (30+ days), please submit an inquiry. Even if we do not have availability, we have additional temp housing companies we can recommend. We also have 50+ homes, so we are able to recommend an open location.

If you are seeking short-term housing (less than 30 days), we have a partner we work with, who may have availability. 

Please reach out to our office with additional questions, support and inquiries.
Pricing & calendar availability is accurate on FHS website only.

With over 20 years of travelling we could easily write our own book on travelling on a budget.  We PRIDE ourselves on the deals we obtain.  A week in Ireland, rental of two 3 bedroom entire homes for $45! FOUR Chicago Bull playoff games during the Michael Jordan Era included 4th row floor seats, box seats...$100 total!  Travelled europe thru 15 countries for $500 including accommodations and food...for a 3 month period!  And this was BEFORE Airbnb. We can go on.  We are geeked when we find a deal and become just plain silly with happiness at an unbelievable deal.  Even upon confirmation, our website for our guests are filled with free and things to do for CRAZY CHEAP.  'Spend like a spencer, but live like a king!'  

We feel everyone should open their minds to new things, cultural experiences and diversity.  Only then can you understand people thru their eyes and not some narrow minded media coverage.  By letting their experience be your experience will help you better understand people in a true and raw sense.  That's why we simply love Airbnb.  It places you in parts of the world where you probably wouldn't have gone but always wanted to go to get that 'local' feel with a local and trusted host.

Thanks for visiting the profile page of FreeStand Home Solutions! 

We here at FHS, operate a corporate housing company, which means businesses and companies contract with us for housing, which typically averages 5-6 months.

We are NOT in the business of vacation renting. 

We simply list on these platforms because this is where businesses and companies come to search for housing.

Due to the nature of our business, we allow these same companies to ""extend"" their stay if they issue a request, 21 days prior to their lease expiration. 

If you are seeking long-term housing (30+ days), please submit an inquiry. Even if we do not have availability, we have additional temp housing companies we can recommend. We also have 50+ homes, so we are able to recommend an open location.

If you are seeking short-term housing (less than 30 days), we have a partner we work with, who may have availability. 

Please reach out to our office with additional questions, support and inquiries.
Pricing & calendar availability is accurate on FHS website only.

With over 20 years of travelling we could easily write our own book on travelling on a budget.  We PRIDE ourselves on the deals we obtain.  A week in Ireland, rental of two 3 bedroom entire homes for $45! FOUR Chicago Bull playoff games during the Michael Jordan Era included 4th row floor seats, box seats...$100 total!  Travelled europe thru 15 countries for $500 including accommodations and food...for a 3 month period!  And this was BEFORE Airbnb. We can go on.  We are geeked when we find a deal and become just plain silly with happiness at an unbelievable deal.  Even upon confirmation, our website for our guests are filled with free and things to do for CRAZY CHEAP.  'Spend like a spencer, but live like a king!'  

We feel everyone should open their minds to new things, cultural experiences and diversity.  Only then can you understand people thru their eyes and not some narrow minded media coverage.  By letting their experience be your experience will help you better understand people in a true and raw sense.  That's why we simply love Airbnb.  It places you in parts of the world where you probably wouldn't have gone but always wanted to go to get that 'local' feel with a local and trusted host.   

Since we don't travel as much as I used to....Let your experience be our experience!

We look forward to meeting you.",691000

We here at FHS, operate a corporate housing company, which means businesses and companies contract with us for housing, which typically averages 5-6 months.

If you are seeking long-term housing (30+ days), please submit an inquiry. Even if we do not have availability, we have additional temp housing companies we can recommend. We also have 50+ homes, so we are able to recommend an open location.

We simply list on these platforms because this is where businesses and companies come to search for housing.

Due to the nature of our business, we allow these same companies to ""extend"" their stay if they issue a request, 21 days prior to their lease expiration. 

If you are seeking long-term housing (30+ days), please submit an inquiry. Even if we do not have availability, we have additional temp housing companies we can recommend. We also have 50+ homes, so we are able to recommend an open location.

If you are seeking short-term housing (less than 30 days), we have a partner we work with, who may have availability. 

Please reach out to our office with additional questions, support and inquiries.

We greatly appreciate the support of our guests in the past many years. Not only we have expanded our teams, we have also increased the number of hosting facilities. We have rooms ranging from more economic models for thrift travelers to luxurious rooms for exceptional experience. With the facilities we have, the guests have a greater choices of suitable locations and budget levels. We have also re-designed some of our facilities so the entire suite or entire floor can be rented. With the large number of guests we served each year, we rely more on self check-in, and regrettably your host may not be able to meet you in person as in the past.

All our facilities are located very convenient and safe neighborhood. We may not have all the bell and whistle of hotel, but in some areas we actually provides more. Most of our hosting facilities include a full kitchen (for light cooking only, as a courtesy to other guests), microwave, refrigerator, washer and dryer. Of course, we have wifi, and internet-ready TV. We would like you to feel that you are staying in a functional home and can stay for an extended period of time.",22094147

54420130,"Hi, I’m Ingrid. I love hosting because it combines my 3 favorite things: travel, design, and Chicago.

TRAVEL - My love for travel started in my previous career dancing professionally with the Houston Ballet. Touring the world was one of the most memorable and funnn experiences of my life. 

DESIGN - After hanging up my pointe shoes, I received an industrial design degree from Parson School of Design, which fulfilled my love of problem solving, making beautiful objects, and creating unique experiences.

CHICAGO - My third and greatest love is for the city of Chicago, a magical place filled with world-class architecture, outstanding theater, exquisite food (and beer!), and the friendliest folks. 

I’ve designed the guest suite as a casual yet considered space in hopes of delighting seasoned travelers. I hope you feel the love when you stay and enjoy Chicago as much as I do!",54420130

When I turned 19 I realized that I was a closet wanderer.  So I hit the road and covered much of the U.S. and all of Europe.  I taught skiing in the Rockies and rode my BMW R65-LS from coast to coast.  When I was in Europe I was amazed at how willing people were to open their homes to a total stranger.  I had one of my best experiences living with a family in Romania in the Carpathian Mountains.  Amazing!  I feel this is the best way possible to travel.  It's part of why I love Air B&B.  Hotel shmotel!  Live the life of the area.  That's an experience.  Now my wandering days are over.  I'm rooted in one of the coolest communities I know.  Rich with art and spirit. I have two amazing girls that help me garden, can, collect eggs and milk.  My partner is a fellow East Coast boy, world class jazz pianist and my right hand man.

With over 20 years of travelling we could easily write our own book on travelling on a budget.  We PRIDE ourselves on the deals we obtain.  A week in Ireland, rental of two 3 bedroom entire homes for $45! FOUR Chicago Bull playoff games during the Michael Jordan Era included 4th row floor seats, box seats...$100 total!  Travelled europe thru 15 countries for $500 including accommodations and food...for a 3 month period!  And this was BEFORE Airbnb. We can go on.  We are geeked when we find a deal and become just plain silly with happiness at an unbelievable deal.  Even upon confirmation, our website for our guests are filled with free and things to do for CRAZY CHEAP.  'Spend like a spencer, but live like a king!'  

We feel everyone should open their minds to new things, cultural experiences and diversity.  Only then can you understand people thru their eyes and not some narrow minded media coverage.  By letting their experience be your experience will help you better understand people in a true and raw sense.  That's why we simply love Airbnb.  It places you in parts of the world where you probably wouldn't have gone but always wanted to go to get that 'local' feel with a local and trusted host.   

Since we don't travel as much as I used to....Let your experience be our experience!

We look forward to meeting you.",691000

Thanks for visiting the profile page of FreeStand Home Solutions! 

We here at FHS, operate a corporate housing company, which means businesses and companies contract with us for housing, which typically averages 5-6 months.

We are NOT in the business of vacation renting. 

We simply list on these platforms because this is where businesses and companies come to search for housing.

Due to the nature of our business, we allow these same companies to ""extend"" their stay if they issue a request, 21 days prior to their lease expiration. 

If you are seeking long-term housing (30+ days), please submit an inquiry. Even if we do not have availability, we have additional temp housing companies we can recommend. We also have 50+ homes, so we are able to recommend an open location.

If you are seeking short-term housing (less than 30 days), we have a partner we work with, who may have availability. 

Please reach out to our office with additional questions, support and inquiries.

My idea of an amazing vacation with friends is sleeping in, and then taking on an adventure activity like hiking or kayaking. My perfect family trip means having a great space for the kids to play, a well equipped kitchen to cook meals, and going on a low key outing like biking, visiting the beach, playground or nearby woods.

We try to replicate what we look for when we travel into our spaces. I love hosting and look forward to sharing our Nest with you. I'll do my best to make your stay comfortable and provide the amenities to make traveling a little bit easier.

In 2016 we bought this 130+ year old historic greystone home.  We spent 18 months meticulously taking it apart one wooden beam at a time. After overhauling the heating, plumbing, & electric with the most efficient systems we could find, we then put it all back together - preserving as much of the original hardwood, bricks & beautiful finishes we possibly could. We found there is indeed truth to the phrase 'labor of love', and we couldn't be more proud of the work we've accomplished.  

Our professional careers revolve around sustainability & we try to lead our lives as close to our environmentally friendly values as we can while still leading modern, robust lives. We love spending as much outdoors time as the weather allows us;  hiking, gardening, skiing - we love it all.  When indoors, we make use of an extensive tool collection (we have an entire storage area dedicated to it), & tinker on home improvements .. most often while sipping either a craft beer or glass of dynamic wine.",16027807

If I'm around and you want to go for a run, I'm definitely down; early morning or evening.  If I can, I will.

I enjoy drawing and beading just for the creative outlet.  My favorite cuisines are Mediterranean, Mexican and Italian.  I love laughter....mine and others.  My favorite travel destination, to date, is the Caribbean; St. Marteen, Cozumel and Belize.  Im a fan of dry humor and have watched The Office, Schitt's Creek, and New Girl several times.

When I turned 19 I realized that I was a closet wanderer.  So I hit the road and covered much of the U.S. and all of Europe.  I taught skiing in the Rockies and rode my BMW R65-LS from coast to coast.  When I was in Europe I was amazed at how willing people were to open their homes to a total stranger.  I had one of my best experiences living with a family in Romania in the Carpathian Mountains.  Amazing!  I feel this is the best way possible to travel.  It's part of why I love Air B&B.  Hotel shmotel!  Live the life of the area.  That's an experience.  Now my wandering days are over.  I'm rooted in one of the coolest communities I know.  Rich with art and spirit. I have two amazing girls that help me garden, can, collect eggs and milk.  My partner is a fellow East Coast boy, world class jazz pianist and my right hand man. I also tour with an ABBA tribute band as well as a Pink Floyd tribute band but don't hold that against me.  I hope you like it here half as much as we do!!",10917550

In the winter of 2019, we packed a few small suitcases and traveled to Southeast Asia for 3 months. During our stay, we lived in places that were enriched by culture, traditions and food that inspired us to one day have a space of our own that we could share with others.

After listing our first property in Sarasota, our love for hosting grew tremendously and since then, we started expanding into other areas that we admire. Our intention is to provide our guests with a home away from home alongside happy-to-assist customer service.

691000,"Love Travelers,  traveling and everything in between.  Born and raised in Chicago, we became avid travellers and barter enthusiasts. With over 20 years of travelling we could easily write our own book on travelling on a budget.  We PRIDE ourselves on the deals we obtain.  A week in Ireland, rental of two 3 bedroom entire homes for $45! FOUR Chicago Bull playoff games during the Michael Jordan Era included 4th row floor seats, box seats...$100 total!  Travelled europe thru 15 countries for $500 including accommodations and food...for a 3 month period!  And this was BEFORE Airbnb. We can go on.  We are geeked when we find a deal and become just plain silly with happiness at an unbelievable deal.  Even upon confirmation, our website for our guests are filled with free and things to do for CRAZY CHEAP.  'Spend like a spencer, but live like a king!'  

We feel everyone should open their minds to new things, cultural experiences and diversity.  Only then can you understand people thru their eyes and not some narrow minded media coverage.  By letting their experience be your experience will help you better understand people in a true and raw sense.  That's why we simply love Airbnb.  It places you in parts of the world where you probably wouldn't have gone but always wanted to go to get that 'local' feel with a local and trusted host.   

Since we don't travel as much as I used to....Let your experience be our experience!

We look forward to meeting you.",691000

I have been hosting on Airbnb since 2012,  a time in which I’ve had more than 500 guests and stayed in over 250 Airbnbs in 44 countries.   Philosophy: have anything I’ve needed after landing at 11pm available to you -- from coffee to cereal & soup to wireless fast chargers -- and to incorporate the best of ABBs I’ve stayed in worldwide.  And make sure you have good sleep:  only a handful of Airbnbs I’ve stayed in, have beds as comfortable as ours-- earplugs and sleep masks nearby.

When I turned 19 I realized that I was a closet wanderer.  So I hit the road and covered much of the U.S. and all of Europe.  I taught skiing in the Rockies and rode my BMW R65-LS from coast to coast.  When I was in Europe I was amazed at how willing people were to open their homes to a total stranger.  I had one of my best experiences living with a family in Romania in the Carpathian Mountains.  Amazing!  I feel this is the best way possible to travel.  It's part of why I love Air B&B.  Hotel shmotel!  Live the life of the area.  That's an experience.  Now my wandering days are over.  I'm rooted in one of the coolest communities I know.  Rich with art and spirit. I have two amazing girls that help me garden, can, collect eggs and milk.  My partner is a fellow East Coast boy, world class jazz pianist and my right hand man.

The Neighborhood Hotel® in Lincoln Park 

Fourteen large, stylish suites feature thoughtful amenities for work and play, a stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, Sonos, and a well-curated collection of art and accessories that reflect the neighborhood's current vibe and history.

Located near the corner of Clark + Wrightwood in a landmark building from the late 1800's, guests are immersed with locals in one of Chicago's most desirable neighborhoods.

The Neighborhood® Grand Beach, Michigan

The Neighborhood Grand Beach is your escape — a place where nature’s bounty is celebrated and pure comfort is prioritized. Imagine your day beginning with sounds of nature, coffee by the campfire followed by a dip in the glistening pool or yoga near the ravine. The adventurer explores the woods and waters of Harbor Country followed by a round of golf or tennis. Meanwhile, the relaxed vacationer continues to bask (possibly reclined) amongst the native trees and greenery. The day comes to a close with a barbeque garnished with fresh herbs from the garden + s’mores under the stars (or in the plush living room for indoor folks).

Fourteen suite's provide the ideal blend of rustic cabin meets ethereal luxury. The common spaces are campy-hip with warm touches that even smell good (think wood paneled walls, aromatic pine trees, smoky embers). This is your place for adventure, connection, or to just chill.

Accessibility: The Neighborhood Hotels are located in a variety of old structures.  In Grand Beach, Michigan, you’ll find yourself in an old roadside in lodge from the early 1900’s.  In Lincoln Park (Chicago), you’ll be in a stately limestone clad building from the late 1800’s. Based on the architectural trends of the time, there may be a considerable amount of steps throughout our buildings.

The Neighborhood Hotel® in Lincoln Park 

Fourteen large, stylish suites feature thoughtful amenities for work and play, a stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, Sonos, and a well-curated collection of art and accessories that reflect the neighborhood's current vibe and history.

Located near the corner of Clark + Wrightwood in a landmark building from the late 1800's, guests are immersed with locals in one of Chicago's most desirable neighborhoods.

The Neighborhood® Grand Beach, Michigan

The Neighborhood Grand Beach is your escape — a place where nature’s bounty is celebrated and pure comfort is prioritized. Imagine your day beginning with sounds of nature, coffee by the campfire followed by a dip in the glistening pool or yoga near the ravine. The adventurer explores the woods and waters of Harbor Country followed by a round of golf or tennis. Meanwhile, the relaxed vacationer continues to bask (possibly reclined) amongst the native trees and greenery. The day comes to a close with a barbeque garnished with fresh herbs from the garden + s’mores under the stars (or in the plush living room for indoor folks).

I taught skiing in the Rockies and rode my BMW R65-LS from coast to coast.  When I was in Europe I was amazed at how willing people were to open their homes to a total stranger.

Started renting my own couch, then my bed, ending up having no where to sleep. Now we have multiples units in the city and it became our main family source of income. Funny fact, nobody believed in what I was doing! ❤️",518917937

I have been hosting on Airbnb since 2012,  a time in which I’ve had more than 500 guests and stayed in over 250 Airbnbs in 44 countries.   Philosophy: have anything I’ve needed after landing at 11pm available to you -- from coffee to cereal & soup to wireless fast chargers -- and to incorporate the best of ABBs I’ve stayed in worldwide.  And make sure you have good sleep:  only a handful of Airbnbs I’ve stayed in, have beds as comfortable as ours-- earplugs and sleep masks nearby.
Professionally,  I am variously trained as a Rhetoritician (Cal: Butler,  Dolan,  Pred),  retooled as a software engineer (AI),  later retooled as an economist via on-the-job training.",100179

I’ve been infected with the travel bug since birth!  Fortunately, my work takes me all around the world to satisfy this wanderlust.  From my days as an exchange student in Australia, to my present-day trips to my favorite city in the world, Tokyo, I've been very blessed to have seen most of this great earth, and cultivate lifelong friendships along the way.

I'm addicted to (good) coffee, food, wine, geeky technology, and anything else with a motor.  You can catch me hanging out with the other locals at Venice Ale House often. ;)
